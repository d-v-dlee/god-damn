### Introduction

In his book "10% Less Democracy", economist Garett Jones makes a compelling case that slightly reducing democratic control in certain areas can lead to better long-term outcomes.  

His central premise is that electoral pressures often lead politicians to prioritize short-term, populist policies over more farsighted but controversial decisions. **Duh.** At the same time, Jones acknowledges that a baseline level of democracy is crucial for preventing catastrophic outcomes like famines and genocides. The sweet spot, he argues, is a system with sufficient democracy to avert disasters but enough autonomy for experts to make sound, long-term decisions without political interference.

To support this argument, Jones points to examples like Singapore, a country that has achieved remarkable economic success and stability despite having a (lot) less democratic system compared to most Western nations. He also highlights the effectiveness of independent central banks, which consistently deliver lower inflation and promote economic growth compared to those controlled directly by political parties. Sure, everyone hates the Fed, but can you imagine how much worse things could be if each presidential office had free reign to do as they please?

Beyond politics, FC Barcelona, one of the world's most iconic football clubs, serves as a compelling case study of an institution that could benefit from 10% less democracy.

### The Barca Shit Storm

FC Barcelona's motto, "MÃ©s que un club," translates to "more than a club." It's a fitting description for an institution that transcends sports. On the pitch, Barca is a powerhouse, boasting some of history's greatest teams (2009-2010) and THE greatest of all time, Lionel Messi. Off the pitch, it's a financial juggernaut, ranking as the world's highest-grossing sports team in 2018. But Barca is also a political machine, a symbol of Catalan independence and pride.

Barca operates under a unique governance model where socios, the voting members, elect the president and board and have a say in major decisions like budget approvals. In theory, this democratic structure is admirable, putting fans in charge of their beloved club. In practice, however, it has created a toxic, complex, and politically charged environment known as the "entorno."

The "entorno" is a melting pot of factions - fans, media, club members, ex-players, agents, and politicians - each with their own agenda and all feeling entitled to weigh in on every decision. This constant pressure pushes the club's leadership towards short-term, populist thinking at the expense of long-term stability.

A brief history of Barca's recent presidents illustrates this chaos:
- **Joan Laporta (2003-2010)**: Oversaw Champions League glory in 2006 and Pep Guardiola's historic sextuple in 2009, but narrowly survived a vote of no confidence in 2008.
- **Sandro Rosell (2010-2014)**: Former VP of Laporta; Ran against Laporta on a platform of transparency and democracy, won UCL in 2011, only to resign amid controversy over Neymar's signing.
- **Josep Bartomeu (2014-2020)**: Presided over the MSN era (Messi, Suarez, Neymar) and the famous treble of 2015, but saddled the club with enormous debts through reckless spending. Resigned in 2020 to avoid a vote of no confidence.
- **Joan Laporta (2021-present)**: Returned with promises to fix the financial mess and keep Messi, but failed to retain the Argentine star. Has resorted to selling off future assets to fund more signings in a desperate bid for immediate success.

This revolving door of presidents, each making short-sighted decisions that compound over time, has left Barca in a dire financial situation. Contrast this with the club's eternal rival, Real Madrid, which has a similar voting structure but operates more like an autocracy under the steady hand of Florentino Perez, who has been president since 2009.

In many ways, Barca is the perfect poster child for the pitfalls of "too much democracy". The constant churn of elections and the need to appease the "entorno" incentivizes short-term decision-making and grandstanding at the expense of the club's long-term health.

Imagine if Barca took a page from Garett Jones' "10% Less Democracy" and implemented reforms to insulate the leadership from these short-term pressures. Longer election cycles (ie 10 years instead of 6) and higher barriers to entry for socios could give presidents the breathing room to make tough but necessary choices.

With more stable leadership, Barca could focus on cleaning up its financial mess, even if it means accepting a few lean years on the pitch. This might involve selling off prized assets (FdJ and Pedri to Arsenal), doubling down on the club's world-renowned youth academy, and resisting the urge to splash the cash on shiny new signings.

It won't be easy, and it will require a cultural shift within the "entorno." But if Barca wants to secure its long-term future and live up to its motto of being "more than a club," a small dose of "less democracy" might just be the bitter medicine it needs.

### Conclusion

FC Barcelona's predicament is a microcosm of the challenges faced by many modern democracies. Just as the club's "entorno" is filled with various factions - fans, media, club members, and politicians - each with their own identities and agendas, Western democracies are increasingly populated by factions of hyper-engaged, hyper-opinionated "political" fans. Similar to the socios, these individuals, feel entitled to voice their views on everything, regardless of their actual expertise or knowledge. 

The solution, as Garett Jones argues in "10% Less Democracy", is not to abandon democracy altogether, but rather to find the balance between democratic accountability and expert decision-making, neither the pure egalitarian "everyone's opinion is equally valid" nor the blind defer to authority "trust the experts". 

Just as Barcelona could benefit from longer intervals between elections and more stringent requirements for voting rights, modern democracies might consider similar reforms to insulate policymakers from the constant pressure of short-term populism. This could involve longer terms for elected officials, more power for independent expert bodies, or even a system that gives greater weight to the votes of more informed and engaged citizens. 

By striking the right balance between democracy and technocracy, Jones suggests that nations can create a more stable, sustainable, and prosperous future.
